# Audio Converter
Simple Python script to convert audio files (like WAV to MP3) using pydub. Messing around with audio tech since Iâ€™m into stuff like ElevenLabs does with voice AI.  

## How to Use
- Install pydub: `pip install pydub`  
- Install FFmpeg (google it)  
- Run: `python convert_audio.py` with a WAV file handy
